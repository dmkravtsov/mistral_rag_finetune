## **Stage 1: Baseline and Fine-Tuning with Mistral**

### **Key Components and Their Roles**

1. **Bits and Bytes Configuration (bnb_config)**  
   - **Purpose**: Compresses model weights into a 4-bit format to optimize memory and computation.  
   - **Interaction**: Prepares the model for efficient processing on GPUs.  
   - **Analogy**: Like lightening a car for better speed.

2. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**  
   - **Purpose**: Fine-tunes the model by adding lightweight, low-rank matrices to specific layers.  
   - **Interaction**: Enhances adaptability while minimizing memory usage.  
   - **Analogy**: Improves transmission for better performance.

3. **TrainingArguments**  
   - **Purpose**: Defines critical training parameters (e.g., batch size, learning rate).  
   - **Interaction**: Controls the training setup and validation frequency.  
   - **Analogy**: Sets the driving conditions for optimal training.

4. **SFTTrainer**  
   - **Purpose**: Central hub for orchestrating training, evaluation, and model saving.  
   - **Interaction**: Manages data flow and applies configurations for efficient fine-tuning.  
   - **Analogy**: Acts as the driver ensuring smooth execution.

### **Results**  
- **Baseline F1 Score**: 86%  
- **Fine-Tuned F1 Score**: 95%

## **Stage 2: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

### **Project Overview**
This stage focuses on automating news analysis using retrieval-augmented generation. By integrating Mistral with vector-based retrieval (FAISS), the system identifies, summarizes, and analyzes relevant news articles, offering actionable insights.

### **Data Structure**
- **titles**: News headlines.  
- **category**: News category (e.g., politics, economy).  
- **combined**: Concatenation of title and category for enhanced semantic representation.

### **Technologies and Tools**

1. **Programming Language**: Python  
2. **Libraries and Frameworks**:  
   - **Pandas**: Data preprocessing.  
   - **LangChain**: Orchestrates the pipeline using language models.  
   - **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: Enables text generation with Mistral.  
   - **FAISS**: Provides efficient vector-based document retrieval.  
   - **SentenceTransformers**: Generates vector embeddings for similarity search.  

3. **Models**:  
   - **Mistral (7B)**: Used for text generation and summarization.  
   - **SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)**: For vector embeddings.

4. **Infrastructure**:  
   - **Kaggle Environment**: For execution and testing.  
   - **GPU Acceleration**: Enhances model inference speed.

### **Workflow**

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**  
   - Load and preprocess a dataset of news headlines.  
   - Combine category and title into a unified textual feature.

2. **Embedding Creation**  
   - Use SentenceTransformer to generate vector embeddings.  
   - Store embeddings in a FAISS index for similarity search.

3. **Query Handling**  
   - **Similarity Search**: Fetches the most relevant articles.  
   - **MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance)**: Balances relevance with diversity.

4. **Text Generation**  
   - Summarizes articles using Mistral.  
   - Extracts three distinct insights based on the summary.

5. **Report Generation**  
   - Outputs a structured report with:  
     - **Top relevant news articles**  
     - **A concise summary**  
     - **Key insights**

### **Key Features**
- **Dynamic Query Handling**: Adapts retrieval strategy based on user queries.  
- **Multi-Agent Structure**: Separate prompts for summarization and insight generation.  
- **Fine-Tuned Hyperparameters**: Optimized for coherent and precise outputs.  
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets efficiently using FAISS.
